# Virtual Pet Simulation

## Project Overview
The Virtual Pet Simulation is an interactive Java application that allows users to care for a virtual pet through feeding, playing, and health management. 
The application is designed to provide an engaging experience with multiple pet types, customizable play options, and integrated mini-games that directly influence the pet’s happiness index.
The project also demonstrates the use of Java Swing for building graphical user interfaces and showcases thoughtful application design, multi-threading, and event-driven programming concepts.

## Features
- **Multiple Pet Types**: Users can choose from a variety of pets, such as dogs, cats, and birds, each with unique play items.
- **Interactive Pet Actions**: Options include feeding, sleeping, playing, and viewing the pet’s health and happiness status.
- **Mini-Games Integration**:
  - Word Guessing Game with hints and an expanded word bank.
  - Trivia Game with question-answer pairs.
  - Additional creative mini-games to boost pet happiness.
- **Customizable Play Interactions**: Users can specify the number of interactions (like the number of throws) during play sessions.
- **Dynamic Health Updates**: The pet’s health and happiness indices are updated in real time, with periodic status checks every 10 seconds.
- **Multi-Level Confirmation Dialogs**:
  - Intelligent dialog management when exiting mini-games or the application.
  - Context-aware prompts when closing different menus to prevent accidental exits.
- **Multithreading**: Background threads manage health updates and time-based status changes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Java Swing to provide interactive menus, buttons, and dialog boxes.

## Java Concepts Utilized
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Multithreading
- Event-Driven Programming
- Exception Handling
- Collections (ArrayList, HashMap)
- Encapsulation
- File I/O (optional for saving progress, if implemented)
- Dialog Management using `JOptionPane`
- GUI Development using Java Swing

---

## Libraries and Frameworks Used
- **Java Swing**: For building the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- **Java Standard Libraries**: Collections, Threads, I/O, Math, and Utility packages.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Designing interactive, user-centric applications using java.
- Developing event-driven Java Swing applications.
- Implementing multithreaded logic to handle real-time updates.
- Managing user input validation and dynamic menu navigation.
- Writing modular, maintainable, and scalable Java code.
- Creating custom mini-games and integrating them within a larger application framework.
- Handling complex user flow and graceful application exits.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Persistent pet data using file storage or databases.
- More pet types with unique behaviors.
- Additional mini-games with increasing difficulty levels.
- Enhanced graphics and animations.
- User accounts for tracking progress across sessions.
